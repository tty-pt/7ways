# 7 ways
> A simple RPG game in the making

Started from forking [pedroth's linux-framebuffer](https://github.com/pedroth/linux-framebuffer). Meant to start developing a small game for a hack-a-tron. Initially, it only used the framebuffer for drawing, but now, for practical reasons, it also supports OpenGL.

## Narrative game
I don't want to say too much, but it is about how an obstacle can also help make a good athelete.
The characters are animals, though :)

## Installation
Check out [these instructions](https://github.com/tty-pt/ci/blob/main/docs/install.md#install-ttypt-packages).
And use "7ways" as the package name.

You can also go to the release page and download **setup.exe** if you are on Windows.
