# Low-level tech rpg experiment

This is a fork of [pedroth's linux-framebuffer](https://github.com/pedroth/linux-framebuffer). Meant to start developing a small game for a hack-a-tron. The idea is to start developing some kind of simple game engine using very low-level stuff. Like the framebuffer for graphics.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `make` to compile the code.
4. Ctrl+Alt+F4 to switch to a virtual terminal.
5. Run `./rpg` to execute the program.
6. Ctrl+Alt+F2 to switch back to the graphical interface.
